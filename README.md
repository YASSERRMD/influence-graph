# Influence Graph Platform

This repository contains a research implementation generated using Chat.z.ai Agent Mode powered by GLM-5.

## Research Context

This project was generated to benchmark GLM-5's capability in modeling dynamic graph-based systems within a relational database environment.

The evaluation focuses on:

- Graph modeling using adjacency lists
- Influence propagation algorithm design
- Time-based decay modeling
- Real-time update integration
- Multi-tenant data isolation

## Project Overview

Influence Graph Platform models weighted influence relationships inside organizations.

It includes:

- Multi-tenant architecture
- Department modeling
- Weighted influence edges
- Influence decay calculation
- Influence propagation logic
- Cross-department analytics
- Volatility metrics
- Interactive graph visualization

## Technology Stack

- Next.js 16
- Node.js API Routes
- Prisma with SQLite
- In-memory caching
- Socket.io
- Docker

## Research Objective

This project evaluates GLM-5’s ability to:

- Model recursive graph structures
- Implement weighted propagation algorithms
- Maintain state consistency
- Integrate analytical computations into full-stack design
